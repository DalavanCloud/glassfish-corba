Note: this version of Jscheme is derived from the original Jscheme 7.2
by removing all of the contributed code and web-related code.
I did this because I do not need the web code, and I want a simple,
self-contained Jscheme which has no dependencies on any code outside
of the JDK.  All of the great work on Jscheme was done by the
original authors.  Any bugs introduced by my modifications are of
course soley my responsbility.
