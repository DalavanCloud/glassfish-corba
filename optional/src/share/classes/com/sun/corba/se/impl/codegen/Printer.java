/** Manages printing of indented source code.

 * every time nl() is called.  Note that the 
 * proper use of this class requires calling nl()
 * at the START of every line (thanks, Harold!),
 * which make indentation much easier to manage.  For example,
 * an if statement can be printed as
 * 
 * nl().p( "if (expr) {" ).in() ;
 * nl().p( "stmt" ).out() ;
 * nl().p( "} else {" ).in() ;
 * nl().p( "stmt" ).out() ;
