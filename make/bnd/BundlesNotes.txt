Some packages are exported in the glassfish-corba-orb bundle because they are
needed at runtime for various reflective operations.  This includes:

com.sun.corba.se.impl.orb: so that ORBSingleton is available
com.sun.corba.se.impl.presentation.rmi: so that CodegenStubBase is available
com.sun.corba.se.spi.trace: while these are internal only, they are
    needed in order for the trace facility code in glassfish-corba-orbgeneric
    to be able to load these classes reflectively from 
    glassfish-corba-orb
com.sun.corba.se.impl.javax.*:
    It seems that we need to make sure that the implementations of the standard
    RMI-IIOP PortableRemoteObject, Stub, and Util classes need to be visible in users
    of glassfish-corba-orb, or the standard javax.rmi.* classes won't be able
    to load the implementations.
