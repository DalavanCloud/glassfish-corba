/** Exception wrapper class.  The logex WrapperGenerator uses this interface
 * to generate an implementation which returns the appropriate exception, and
 * generates a log report when the method is called.  This is used for all
 * implementation classes in this package.
 *
 * The exception IDs are allocated in blocks of EXCEPTIONS_PER_CLASS, which is
 * a lot more than is needed, but we have 32 bits for IDs, and multiples of
 * a suitably chosen EXCEPTIONS_PER_CLASS (like 100 here) are easy to read in
 * error messages.
