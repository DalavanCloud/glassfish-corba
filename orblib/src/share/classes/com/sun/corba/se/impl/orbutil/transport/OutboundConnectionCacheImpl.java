/** Manage connections that are initiated from this VM. Connections are managed 
 * by a get/release mechanism and cached by the ContactInfo used to create them.
 * For efficiency, multiple connections (referred to as parallel connections)
 * may be created using the same ContactInfo.  Connections are reclaimed when 
 * they are no longer in use and there are too many connections open.
 * <P>
 * A connection is obtained through the get method, and released back to the 
 * cache through the release method.  Note that a connection that is released 
 * may still be expecting a response, in which case the connection is NOT 
 * eligible for reclamation.  If a connection is released to the cache while 
 * expecting a response, the connection must me made available for reclamation 
 * by calling responseReceived.
 *
 * XXX Should a get/release cycle expect at most one response?  
 * Should it support more than one response?  
 * Are there cases where we don't know in advance how many responses
 * are expected?
 * <P>
 * A connection basically represents some sort of communication channel, but 
 * few requirements are placed on the connection.  Basically the ability to 
 * close a connection is required in order for reclamation to work.
 * <P> 
 * Also we need the ContactInfo as a factory for the Connection.
