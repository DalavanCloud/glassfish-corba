     * as fast as possible, because it is called a lot, even when 
     * tracing is not enabled.  This method is called at the start
     * of every method that has a tracing annotation.
     * In particular, synchronized is too slow, and it is suspected that
     * volatile may be too slow as well.
     * <p>
     * The consequences of not synchronizing here are that a content(T) call
     * may NEVER become visible in some threads.  This means that turning on
     * tracing while the system is running may not capture all methods
     * that should be traced.
     * <P>
     * Note that in GF 3.1, we NORMALLY only enabled ORB tracing using
     * -Dcom.sun.corba.ee.Debug, which only happens at GF startup time,
     * so this is not too big a problem.  However, it is possible to change
     * tracing flags using a ORB MBean, which could definitely cause 
     * the problem mentioned above.
