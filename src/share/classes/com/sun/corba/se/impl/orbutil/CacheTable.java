/** This is a hash table implementation that simultaneously maps key to value
 * and value to key.  It is used for marshalling and unmarshalling value types,
 * where it is necessary to track the correspondence between object instances
 * and their offsets in a stream.  It is also used for tracking indirections for
 * Strings that represent codebases and repositoryids.
 * Since the offset is always non-negative,
 * only non-negative values should be stored here (and storing -1 will cause
 * failures).  Also note that the same key (Object) may be stored with multiple
 * values (int offsets) due to the way readResolve works (see also GlassFish issue 1605).
 * <P>
 * Note that this class cannot be generified, as any arbitrary object can be a key.
