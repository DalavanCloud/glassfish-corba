      <h1>Java Serialization test cases</h1>
      <p>Basic design is the same as copyobject tests</p>
      <h2>Functionality tests</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>all of the copyobject tests (most of java.util is covered)</li>
          <li>readResolve/writeReplace</li>
          <li>serialPersistentFields</li>
          <li>transient fields</li>
          <li>writeObject/readObject</li>
          <li>externalizable</li>
          <li>putFields/getFields</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Performance tests</h2>
      <p>These can be taken somewhat from the StandardTest</p>
      <ol>
          <li>stream creation</li>
          <li>read/write primitve array 10000 elements</li>
          <li>read/write array of 1000 bean-style classes, each contains 10 fields</li>
          <li>large Map<String,String> (1000 entries)</li>
          <li>large complex graph (can use copyobject code)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Eventually we need to deal with type evolution.  This would also be
          useful to support copyobject semantics between different class loaders
          in the sender and receiver (particularly under OSGi).</p>
