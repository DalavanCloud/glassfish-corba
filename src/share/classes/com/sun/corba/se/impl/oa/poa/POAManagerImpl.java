    /** activeManagers is the set of POAManagerImpls for which a thread has called
     * enter without exit 1 or more times.  Once a thread has entered a POAManager,
     * it must be able to re-enter the POAManager, even if the manager is HOLDING,
     * because state transitions can be deferred until all threads have completed execution
     * and called exit().  Without this change, one thread can be blocked on the
     * state change method, and another thread that has entered the POAManager once
     * can be blocked from re-entry on a nested co-located call.  This leads to a 
     * permanent deadlock between the two threads.  See Bug 6586417.
     *
     * To avoid this, we create a set of active managers, and record which managers
     * a particular thread is using.  A thread may re-enter any manager in HOLDING state 
     * once it has entered it for the first time.  Note that POAManagerImpl uses the
     * default equals and hashCode methods inherited from Object.  This is fine,
     * because two distinct POAManagerImpl instances always represent distinct
     * POAManagerImpls.
     *
     * This is only a partial solution to the problem, but it should be sufficient for
     * the app server, because all EJBs in the app server share the same POAManager.
     * The problem in general is that state changes between multiple POAManager and
     * invocation threads that make co-located calls to different POAManagers can still
     * deadlock.  This problem requires a different solution, because the hold_requests 
     * method may have already returned when the active thread needs to enter the 
     * holding POAManager, so we can't just let the thread in.  I think in this case
     * we need to reject the request because it may cause a deadlock.  So, checkState
     * needs to throw a TRANSIENT exception if it finds that the thread is already active
     * in one or more POAManagers, AND it tries to enter a new POAManager.  Such exceptions
     * should be re-tried by the client, and will succeed after 
     * the holding POAManagers have been resumed.
     *
     * Another possible route to fix the app server bug (more globally) is to have the RFM 
     * suspend method use discard instead of hold.  This may be better in some ways, 
     * but early tests with that approach led to some problems (which I can't recall right now).  
     * I suspect the issues may have been related to problems with the client-side retry logic,
     * but those problems have now been fixed.  In any case, we need to fix the POAManager
     * issues.

/****************************************************************************
 * The following four public methods are used to change the POAManager's state.
 *
 * A note on the design of synchronization code:
 * There are 4 places where a thread would need to wait for a condition:
 *      - in hold_requests, discard_requests, deactivate, enter 
 * There are 5 places where a thread notifies a condition:
 *      - in activate, hold_requests, discard_requests, deactivate, exit 
 *
 * Since each notify needs to awaken waiters in several of the 4 places,
 * and since wait() in Java has the nice property of releasing the lock
 * on its monitor before sleeping, it seemed simplest to have just one
 * monitor object: "this". Thus all notifies will awaken all waiters.
 * On waking up, each waiter verifies that the condition it was waiting 
 * for is satisfied, otherwise it goes back into a wait().
