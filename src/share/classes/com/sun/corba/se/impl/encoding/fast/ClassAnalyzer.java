/** Analyze a class to determine its structure for serialization.
 * The results of this class are INDEPENDENT of the serialization algorithm.
 * In particular, no assumption is made that we can compute field offsets at this 
 * level, as every serialization scheme has its own constraints on this: 
 * JRMP simply packs
 * everything together, IIOP must obey CDR padding rules, and Emerge has typecodes
 * between values, all packed together on byte boundaries.  However, all protocols
 * will order fields the same way: first all fields of primitive type, then all
 * fields of non-primitive type.  Within each section, fields are ordered alphabetically
 * by field name.  Currently JRMP support unshared fields, but only if using 
 * serialPersistentFields to specify the class serialization.  IIOP and Emerge
 * will not support this (strange) feature.
 *
 * XXX Making a lot of these methods public is a security risk.  We will need
 * to control access to the ClassAnalyzer using a Permission.
