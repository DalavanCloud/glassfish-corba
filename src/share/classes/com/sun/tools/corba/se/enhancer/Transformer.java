/** ClassFile enhancer for the tracing facility.  This modifies the bytecode
 * for an applicable class, then returns the updated bytecode.
 * Makes extensive use of the ASM library.
 *
 * This is split into two parts.  The first part modifies the schema
 * of the class as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Adds static fields as required for the SynchronizedHolder<MethodMonitor> 
 * instances.
 * <li>Modifies the static initializer to set up the new fields, and register
 * the class with the MethodMonitorRegistry.  This also constructs the list
 * of method names, which is needed by the second part.
 * <li>Re-writes all @InfoMethod methods to take two extra parameters at the
 * end of their argument lists.
 * <li>Re-writes all calls to @InfoMethod methods to supply the two extra 
 * parameters to all calls.
 * <li>Checks that @InfoMethod methods (which must be private) are only called
 * from MM annotated methods.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The second part modifies the MM annotated methods as follows:
 * <li>Adds a preamble to set up some local variables, and to call 
 * the MethodMonitor.enter method when active.
 * <li>Adds a finally block at the end of the method that handles calling
 * MethodMonitor.exit whenever an exception is thrown or propagated from the
 * body of the method.
 * <li>Modifies all exit point in the method as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the exit point is a return, call MethodMonitor.exit before the return.
 * <li>If the exit point is a throw, call MethodMonitor.exception before the throw.
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that the second part could be run in a ClassFileTransformer or ClassLoader
 * if desired, since this design enhances the class files in place for the first
 * part.
